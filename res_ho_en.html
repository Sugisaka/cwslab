                More than 10 million elements are processed in the nanometer scale on computer chips. In the factory, the elements are processed by projecting an image of the wiring pattern on a semiconductor wafer. This method is called photolithography and has achieved miniaturization of electronic circuits by projecting light with a shorter wavelength.
            </p>
            <p>
                A device that transfers a wiring pattern to a semiconductor wafer is called a stepper. A wiring pattern is processed on the reticle and projected onto the wafer using a large number of lenses and mirrors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Smaller wiring patterns can be projected by using shorter-wavelength light such as ultraviolet light, but this approach too is reaching its limits.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Light having a shorter wavelength than this does not pass through the lens but requires a mirror instead. The image created by the mirror is very dark, and the reduction rate of the image is low.
                </li>
                <li>
                    	Even a small amount of dust on the reticle causes the projected wiring to break or short circuit. (requires large-scale equipment to improve cleanliness)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src='res_fig_en-03.svg'/>
            <p>
                If an image can be projected using a hologram, there will be no need for a lens or mirror. Dust on the hologram surface does not adversely affect the image.
            </p>

                In this laboratory, we are developing holograms called &quot;quasicrystal holograms&quot; and &quot;photon sieve holograms&quot; that can directly project microscale images without a lens or mirror. When a hologram pattern is designed from a base layout that combines diamonds and circles, process it onto glass, and shine light on it, a microscale image appears.
