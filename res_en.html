                We are developing various new technologies that utilize the properties of light and radio waves. A large amount of information is hidden, similar to code, not only in radio waves and optical communication signals of wireless communication but also in the light reflected from objects around us. If we can extract such information or embed it to light, we may be able to produce a new form of information technology. Research work varies from fundamental to application-oriented studies, including studies on manufacturing aimed at fine processing, measurement studies that measure the shape of objects using light, studies on developing artificial intelligence using light waves, physics research that analyzes the scattering phenomena of light and radio waves, mathematical studies that explore ways to solve problems more efficiently, and research on creating new programming languages that are easy to use. Rather than being research work that uses advanced mathematics and physics, these are studies where researchers freely come up with ideas and turn these into reality. We have been active in publicizing our research and invention (patent applications). In addition, some activities such as seminars are being carried out jointly with the Wave Electronics Laboratory of Kitami Institute of Technology.
